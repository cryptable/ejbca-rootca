Patched EJBCA
=============
EJBCA to support openJDK 11, Wildfly 18 and a NitroKey. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B, which I got from Primekey on the RSA conference last year. It is a little bit slow in starting up, but once started it runs acceptable if youy have patience.
Probably it runs much faster with Raspberry Pi 4 4Gb
